-- Mock of the Agent functionality

-- We'll support Lua and Python plugins. Python is more familiar to most people
-- and should get more contributors, but it can't be fully embedded into the
-- RRaMA binary. Lua is a bit more obscure, but it can be embedded into the
-- binary and it's also a very simple language. So, Python for community plugins
-- and Lua for core plugins that we want to ship with the binary.
